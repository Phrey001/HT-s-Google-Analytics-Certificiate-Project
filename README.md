# HT-s-Google-Analytics-Certificiate-Project

This R markdown file on Kaggle comes with a set with the PowerPoint presentation file stored in GitHub, which is referenced in the SHARE and ACT PHASE.

The plots did not render properly on Kaggle - suggest downloading to the local environment (eg. RStudio) with the relevant datasets analysed which run successfully for me.

For the code "read_csv()" in the script, have to edit to the correct directories should you download to the local environment, as currently the code in Kaggle is referenced to the dataset on Kaggle's cloud directly instead.
